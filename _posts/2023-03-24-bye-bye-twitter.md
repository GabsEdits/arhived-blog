I want to share with you why I left Twitter. When I first signed up for Twitter, it was because I was a big fan of gaming. I loved playing games and connecting with other gamers online. Twitter was a great way for me to share my experiences, get updates on the latest games and events, and connect with other like-minded individuals.

However, as time passed, my interests changed. I found myself spending less time playing games and more time doing coding, other hobbies and interests. At the same time, I noticed that my engagement on Twitter had started to decline. I wasn't finding the same level of excitement and enjoyment that I once did.

After some reflection, I came to the realization that Twitter was no longer relevant to my interests. I wasn't interested in gaming anymore, and therefore, Twitter was no longer serving its original purpose for me. I found that I was using the platform less and less, and it had become just another app on my phone that I rarely opened.

If you are also feeling like Twitter is no longer relevant to your interests, I encourage you to consider taking a break or leaving the platform altogether. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and interests above social media. Life is too short to spend time on things that don't bring you joy and fulfillment. For now, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@gabs) and that's it for now, also this is my first ever blog :D
